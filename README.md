## Welcome to React Markdown Viewer Project

The ReactMarkdown project offers users a seamless experience across devices, with all user records securely saved in a MongoDB database. Users can register, log in, and If they forget their password, they can reset it via email by clicking the link they receive and resetting the password. Upon logging in, they are directed to the home page, where they can create new projects. The project creation form includes  fields like title, date, markdown input and output. The markdown input field have various functionalities such as copying, clearing, saving to PC, and uploading options. Users can preview their Markdown content and download it as a PDF or HTML file. After submitting a project, the submission time is automatically recorded. In the "My Projects" section, users can view a list of all their projects, each displaying the title, creation date, and time. They can easily edit, view, or delete any of their projects. The application is designed to be user-friendly and responsive, with styling done using MUI Bootstrap to ensure a consistent experience across different devices. All user records, including project details and authentication data, are securely saved in a MongoDB database, providing a scalable and efficient way to store and retrieve user data. Finally, users can log out when they are finished using the application.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
